Design Choices: Why you chose your frontend framework, backend structure, and database schema

I chose my frontend because it would be interesting to see how vercel worked. I was already pretty familiar with next.js, so vercel was the logical choice for the framework. I chose Render because I did plenty of research and found that Render works pretty well with Vercel. I chose Neon for my database because once again, i was already familiar with Neon so I chose it for simplicity sake.

Challenges: Technical or conceptual hurdles you faced and how you solved them

Honestly, the 2 biggest technical problems I had was getting the backend to work with the frontend, and properly implementing the IGDB api database to work with my database. The conceptual hurdle that I had to overcome was deciding what would be the restrictions and rules of the website. I gave my friends access to the website, and let them write whatever they wanted on the reviews. But I had the dilemma whether or not to remove some reviews. I then came to the conclusion that so long as the reviews does not offend or break any laws, etc. , its fine. The purpose of this website was to let the users have the power to speak their mind without having to be careful with what they said.

Learning Outcomes: What you learned about full-stack development and deployment

I genuienly had a lot of fun making this project. I was confused at first how I was going to implement a constant webserver that is linked to github, but now that I know how to do it, it was a very fun and worthwile experience. I would love to continue to work on this project in the future and improve on it.

Future Work: Features you would add or refine with more time

Obvious features that i wish i would have had the time to add was basic stuff like, being able to comment on other peoples reviews, make the games more dynamic, and show the game list better and without a cap. definitely improve on the profile page.
